Fake News Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms

This Project is to solve the problem with fake news. In this we have used two datasets named "Fake" and "True" from Kaggle. You can download the file from here https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
In this project, I've used various machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.
